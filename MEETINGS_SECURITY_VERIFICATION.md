## 🚨 Security Vulnerabilities FIXED

### 1. **Attendee Sharing Vulnerability** (CRITICAL!)

**Before (Lines 211-218):**

```javascript
// ❌ SECURITY HOLE! Could find users from ANY company
const users = await User.find({
  $or: [{ name: { $in: attendees } }, { username: { $in: attendees } }],
  isActive: true,
});
// Result: Meeting shared with users from ALL companies! ❌
```

**After (Lines 211-224):**

```javascript
// ✅ SECURE! Only finds users from YOUR company
const userQuery = {
  $or: [{ name: { $in: attendees } }, { username: { $in: attendees } }],
  isActive: true,
  _id: { $ne: req.user.id },
};
// Add company filter
if (req.user.role !== "superadmin") {
  userQuery.companyId = req.companyId; // ✅ CRITICAL FIX
}
const users = await User.find(userQuery);
```

### 2. **Meeting Notifications Vulnerability** (CRITICAL!)

**Before (Line 258):**

```javascript
// ❌ SECURITY HOLE! Notifies ALL users in entire database!
const recipients = await User.find({
  role: { $in: ["manager", "user"] },
  isActive: true,
});
// Result: All companies get notified about your meetings! ❌
```

**After (Lines 264-271):**

```javascript
// ✅ SECURE! Only notifies users from YOUR company
const recipientQuery = {
  role: { $in: ["manager", "user"] },
  isActive: true,
};
// Filter by company
if (req.user.role !== "superadmin") {
  recipientQuery.companyId = req.companyId; // ✅ CRITICAL FIX
}
const recipients = await User.find(recipientQuery);
console.log("🔵 Notifying users in company:", recipients.length);
```

### 3. **Middleware Order Fixed** (Lines 12-13)

**Before:**

```javascript
router.use(tenantFilter);  // ❌ Before auth
router.get('/', auth, ...)
```

**After:**

```javascript
router.use(auth);          // ✅ Auth first
router.use(tenantFilter);  // ✅ Then companyId
router.get('/', ...)
```

## 🚨 What Was At Risk

### Before - CRITICAL ISSUES:

**Scenario 1: Cross-Company Meeting Sharing**

```
Company A creates meeting with attendees: ["john", "mary"]
System finds "john" and "mary" from ANY company
Result: Company B users get access to Company A meeting! 🚨
```

**Scenario 2: Cross-Company Notifications**

```
Company A creates meeting
System notifies ALL managers/users in database
Result: Company B gets notified about Company A meetings! 🚨
```

**Scenario 3: Meeting Visibility**

```
Company A meetings visible in Company B
Data leakage across companies! 🚨
```

---

## ✅ After Fixes - SECURE

### Scenario 1: Company-Specific Sharing ✅

```
Company A creates meeting with attendees: ["john", "mary"]
System finds "john" and "mary" ONLY from Company A
Query: { name: {$in: ["john","mary"]}, companyId: "comp_A" }
Result: Only Company A users get access ✅
```

### Scenario 2: Company-Specific Notifications ✅

```
Company A creates meeting
System notifies only Company A managers/users
Query: { role: {$in: ["manager","user"]}, companyId: "comp_A" }
Result: Only Company A gets notified ✅
```

### Scenario 3: Meeting Isolation ✅

```
Company A meetings: Only visible in Company A
Company B meetings: Only visible in Company B
Complete isolation ✅
```

## 🧪 Security Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Create Meeting with Attendees

**Company A (3 users: fudd, john, mary):**

```bash
1. Login as Company A admin
2. Create meeting "Team Standup"
3. Add attendees: ["john", "mary"]
4. Server logs:
   🔵 User query: {"name":{$in:["john","mary"]},"companyId":"comp_A"}
   ✅ Found users for sharing in company: [john, mary from Company A]
5. ✅ Only Company A john and mary get access
```

**Company B:**

```bash
# Company B also has users named "john" and "mary"
1. Login as Company B admin
2. View meetings
3. ✅ Cannot see "Team Standup" from Company A
4. ✅ Complete isolation
```

### Test 2: Meeting Notifications

**Company A creates meeting:**

```bash
Server logs:
🔵 Notifying users in company: 2
(Only Company A managers/users notified)
```

**Company B:**

```bash
✅ NO notification received
✅ Complete isolation
```

### Test 3: View Meetings

**Company A:**

```bash
GET /api/meetings
Query: { deleted: false, companyId: "comp_A" }
Result: Only Company A meetings ✅
```

**Company B:**

```bash
GET /api/meetings
Query: { deleted: false, companyId: "comp_B" }
Result: Only Company B meetings ✅
```
