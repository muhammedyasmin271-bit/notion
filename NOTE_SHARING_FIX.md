# Note Sharing Fix

## Problem
When a user creates a note and shares it with another person:
- The creator can see the note in "Share Note" filter
- The recipient CANNOT see the note in "Received Note" filter
- The recipient does NOT receive any notification about the shared note

## Root Causes

### 1. Missing Notifications
The backend was not creating notifications when notes were shared. Recipients had no way to know a note was shared with them.

### 2. Incorrect Filter Logic
The "Received Note" filter logic was checking if the note author was different OR if the note was shared, which was incorrect. It should only show notes that are explicitly shared WITH the current user.

## Solution

### Backend Fix (server/routes/notepad.js)
Added notification creation when notes are shared:

```javascript
// Create notifications for each newly shared user
const noteAuthor = await User.findById(req.user.id).select('name username');
const authorName = noteAuthor?.name || noteAuthor?.username || 'Someone';

for (const userId of newUserIds) {
  try {
    const notification = new Notification({
      recipient: userId,
      sender: req.user.id,
      type: 'note',
      priority: 'normal',
      title: 'Note Shared With You',
      message: `${authorName} shared a note "${note.title}" with you`,
      entityType: 'Note',
      entityId: note._id,
      metadata: {
        noteTitle: note.title,
        noteId: note._id,
        sharedBy: req.user.id,
        sharedByName: authorName
      }
    });
    await notification.save();
  } catch (notifError) {
    console.error(`Failed to create notification for user ${userId}:`, notifError);
  }
}
```

### Frontend Fix (src/components/NotepadPage/NotepadPage.js)
Fixed the "Received Note" filter logic:

**Before:**
```javascript
(selectedTag === 'received' && (noteAuthorId !== currentUserId || isSharedWithMe))
```

**After:**
```javascript
(selectedTag === 'received' && isSharedWithMe)
```

Also improved the `isSharedWithMe` check to properly compare user IDs:
```javascript
const isSharedWithMe = note.sharedWith && note.sharedWith.some(share => {
  const shareUserId = typeof share === 'object' ? (share.user?._id || share.user) : share;
  return String(shareUserId) === String(currentUserId);
});
```

## How It Works Now

1. **When sharing a note:**
   - Manager/Admin shares note with users
   - Backend creates notification for each recipient
   - Notification includes note title, sender name, and link to note

2. **For the recipient:**
   - Receives notification about shared note
   - Can click "Received Note" filter to see all notes shared with them
   - Can view and read the shared note

3. **For the creator:**
   - Can see shared notes in "Share Note" filter
   - Can see who the note is shared with
   - Can remove users from shared list

## Testing

1. **As Manager/Admin:**
   - Create a new note
   - Click "Share" button
   - Select users to share with
   - Click "Share Note"
   - Verify note appears in "Share Note" filter

2. **As Recipient:**
   - Check notifications (should see "Note Shared With You")
   - Click "Received Note" filter
   - Verify the shared note appears
   - Click on the note to view it

## Notes

- Only Managers and Admins can share notes
- Recipients can only view shared notes (read-only)
- Notifications are created for email and SMS if user has those enabled
- The fix ensures proper ID comparison using String() to handle ObjectId types
