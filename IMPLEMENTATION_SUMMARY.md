# Multi-Tenant Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Has Been Completed

### 1. Frontend Changes

#### Login Page (`src/components/auth/LoginPage.js`)
- ✅ Added URL parameter detection for `?company=COMPANY_ID`
- ✅ Fetches company branding (logo, name) from backend
- ✅ Displays company-specific logo and name
- ✅ Passes companyId to login API

#### Context & Services
- ✅ Updated `AppContext.js` to accept companyId in login function
- ✅ Updated `api.js` service to send companyId with login request

### 2. Backend Changes

#### Authentication (`server/routes/auth.js`)
- ✅ Added `GET /api/auth/company/:companyId` endpoint to fetch company branding
- ✅ Updated login endpoint to filter by companyId
- ✅ Login now validates user belongs to specified company

#### Middleware
- ✅ Updated `auth.js` to include companyId in req.user
- ✅ Created `tenantFilter.js` middleware for automatic tenant filtering
- ✅ Middleware skips filtering for superadmin role

#### Database Models
Added `companyId` field to all major models:
- ✅ `User.js` (already existed)
- ✅ `Project.js`
- ✅ `Document.js`
- ✅ `Note.js`
- ✅ `Goal.js`
- ✅ `MeetingNote.js`
- ✅ `Task.js`

#### Company Management (`server/routes/admin.js`)
- ✅ Super admin can create companies
- ✅ Each company gets unique companyId
- ✅ Company admin user is auto-created
- ✅ Company link is generated: `http://localhost:3000/login?company=COMPANY_ID`

### 3. Migration & Documentation
- ✅ Created `migrateCompanyData.js` script
- ✅ Created comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Created quick start guide

## ⚠️ What Still Needs To Be Done

### 1. Route Updates (CRITICAL)
All route files need to be updated to filter by companyId:

**Priority 1 (Core Features):**
- [ ] `server/routes/projects.js` - Add companyId to all queries
- [ ] `server/routes/documents.js` - Add companyId filtering
- [ ] `server/routes/notepad.js` - Add companyId filtering
- [ ] `server/routes/users.js` - Filter users by companyId

**Priority 2 (Additional Features):**
- [ ] `server/routes/goals.js`
- [ ] `server/routes/meetings.js`
- [ ] `server/routes/tasks.js`
- [ ] `server/routes/reports.js`
- [ ] `server/routes/notifications.js`

### 2. Route Update Pattern

For each route file, apply this pattern:

```javascript
// At the top
const { tenantFilter } = require('../middleware/tenantFilter');

// Apply to all routes
router.use(tenantFilter);

// In GET routes
router.get('/', auth, async (req, res) => {
  // Add companyId filter (skip for superadmin)
  const query = req.user.role === 'superadmin' 
    ? {} 
    : { companyId: req.companyId };
  
  const items = await Model.find(query);
  res.json(items);
});

// In POST routes
router.post('/', auth, async (req, res) => {
  const item = new Model({
    ...req.body,
    companyId: req.companyId // Auto-assign from logged-in user
  });
  await item.save();
  res.json(item);
});

// In GET by ID routes
router.get('/:id', auth, async (req, res) => {
  const query = { _id: req.params.id };
  
  // Add companyId filter (skip for superadmin)
  if (req.user.role !== 'superadmin') {
    query.companyId = req.companyId;
  }
  
  const item = await Model.findOne(query);
  if (!item) {
    return res.status(404).json({ message: 'Not found' });
  }
  res.json(item);
});
```

### 3. User Registration Updates
- [ ] Update user registration to inherit companyId from creator
- [ ] Prevent users from registering without company context
- [ ] Add company validation in registration flow

### 4. Testing
- [ ] Test with multiple companies
- [ ] Verify data isolation
- [ ] Test super admin can see all companies
- [ ] Test company admin can only see their company
- [ ] Test regular users can only see their company data

### 5. Additional Features (Optional)
- [ ] Company settings page
- [ ] Company usage statistics
- [ ] Company billing integration
- [ ] Company-specific themes
- [ ] Company-specific email templates

## 🚀 How to Complete Implementation

### Step 1: Run Migration
```bash
cd server
node migrateCompanyData.js
```

### Step 2: Update Routes (Example: projects.js)
```javascript
// Add at top of file
const { tenantFilter } = require('../middleware/tenantFilter');

// Add middleware
router.use(tenantFilter);

// Update GET all projects
router.get('/', auth, async (req, res) => {
  const query = { archived: false };
  
  // Add company filter (skip for superadmin)
  if (req.user.role !== 'superadmin') {
    query.companyId = req.companyId;
  }
  
  // Add role-based filtering
  if (req.user.role === 'admin') {
    // Admin sees all company projects
  } else if (req.user.role === 'manager') {
    // Manager sees assigned projects
    query.$or = [
      { owner: req.user.id },
      { assignedTo: { $in: [req.user.username] } }
    ];
  } else {
    // Regular user sees only their projects
    query.owner = req.user.id;
  }
  
  const projects = await Project.find(query);
  res.json(projects);
});

// Update POST create project
router.post('/', auth, async (req, res) => {
  const project = new Project({
    ...req.body,
    owner: req.user.id,
    companyId: req.companyId // Auto-assign company
  });
  await project.save();
  res.json(project);
});
```

### Step 3: Test Each Route
After updating each route:
1. Create test data as company admin
2. Login as different company admin
3. Verify you cannot see first company's data
4. Login as super admin
5. Verify you can see all companies' data

### Step 4: Deploy
Once all routes are updated and tested:
1. Run migration on production database
2. Deploy updated code
3. Monitor logs for any data leakage
4. Test thoroughly in production

## 📋 Testing Checklist

### Basic Functionality
- [ ] Super admin can create companies
- [ ] Company link is generated correctly
- [ ] Company logo displays on login page
- [ ] Company name displays on login page
- [ ] Login with company URL works
- [ ] Login without company URL works (default company)

### Data Isolation
- [ ] Company A users cannot see Company B projects
- [ ] Company A users cannot see Company B documents
- [ ] Company A users cannot see Company B users
- [ ] Company A users cannot see Company B notes
- [ ] Super admin can see all companies' data

### User Management
- [ ] Company admin can create users in their company
- [ ] Created users automatically get company's companyId
- [ ] Users can only see other users in their company
- [ ] Company admin cannot see users from other companies

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Invalid companyId in URL shows error
- [ ] Inactive company cannot login
- [ ] User with wrong companyId cannot login to company
- [ ] API calls without companyId are rejected
- [ ] Direct API access is blocked for other companies

## 🔒 Security Considerations

1. **Always filter by companyId** - Every database query must include companyId filter
2. **Validate company exists** - Check company exists and is active before allowing login
3. **Never expose companyId** - Don't show companyId in frontend (except in URL)
4. **Audit logging** - Log all cross-company access attempts
5. **Rate limiting** - Limit login attempts per company
6. **Data encryption** - Consider encrypting sensitive company data
