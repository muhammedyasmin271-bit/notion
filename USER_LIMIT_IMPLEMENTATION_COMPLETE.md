# ✅ User Limit Enforcement - COMPLETE

## 🎯 Summary

**User limit enforcement has been successfully implemented!**

When a company has a `maxUsers` limit (e.g., 2 users), the system now prevents:

- ❌ New user registrations
- ❌ Admin/Manager creating new users
- ❌ Approving pending users

---

## 📋 What Was Implemented

### 1. Registration Endpoint (`/api/auth/register`)

**Added check BEFORE creating user:**

```javascript
const currentUserCount = await User.countDocuments({
  companyId: userCompanyId,
  status: { $ne: "declined" },
});

if (currentUserCount >= maxUsers) {
  return res.status(403).json({
    message:
      "This company has reached its maximum user limit (X users). Please contact your administrator.",
  });
}
```

### 2. Manager/Admin User Creation (`/api/auth/register-user`)

**Added check BEFORE creating user:**

```javascript
const company = await Company.findOne({ companyId: req.user.companyId });
if (company) {
  const currentUserCount = await User.countDocuments({
    companyId: req.user.companyId,
    status: { $ne: "declined" },
  });

  if (currentUserCount >= maxUsers) {
    return res.status(403).json({
      message:
        "Your company has reached its maximum user limit (X users). Please contact the super administrator to increase the limit.",
    });
  }
}
```

### 3. API User Creation (`/api/users POST`)

**Same check as #2** - prevents creation when limit reached

### 4. User Approval Endpoints

**All 3 approval endpoints now check:**

- `/api/users/:id/approve` (Manager)
- `/api/auth/users/:id/approve` (Manager)
- `/api/auth/admin/users/:id/approve` (Admin)

```javascript
if (user.status === "pending") {
  const currentUserCount = await User.countDocuments({
    companyId: user.companyId,
    status: "approved",
    isActive: true,
  });

  if (currentUserCount >= maxUsers) {
    return res.status(403).json({
      message:
        "Cannot approve user. Company has reached its maximum user limit (X users). Please contact the super administrator to increase the limit.",
    });
  }
}
```

## 🎯 How It Works

### User Counting Logic

**For Registration & Creation:**

```javascript
// Count all users except declined ones
User.countDocuments({
  companyId: userCompanyId,
  status: { $ne: "declined" },
});
```

This includes:

- ✅ Approved users (active and inactive)
- ✅ Pending users
- ❌ Declined users (excluded)

**For Approval:**

```javascript
// Count only approved active users
User.countDocuments({
  companyId: user.companyId,
  status: "approved",
  isActive: true,
});
```

This ensures:

- Pending users can be approved if there's room
- Only counts currently active approved users

## 📊 Example Flow

### Scenario: Company with `maxUsers: 2`

**Step 1: Initial State**

- No users yet
- Limit: 2 users

**Step 2: User 1 Registers**

- ✅ **Allowed** (0/2 users)
- Status: pending (awaiting approval)

**Step 3: User 2 Registers**

- ✅ **Allowed** (1/2 users - User 1 is pending)
- Status: pending (awaiting approval)

**Step 4: User 3 Tries to Register**

- ❌ **BLOCKED** (2/2 users - both pending)
- Error: "Company has reached its maximum user limit (2 users)"

**Step 5: Admin Approves User 1**

- ✅ **Allowed** (0/2 approved active users)
- User 1 status: approved, active

**Step 6: Admin Approves User 2**

- ✅ **Allowed** (1/2 approved active users)
- User 2 status: approved, active

**Step 7: User 3 Tries to Register Again**

- ❌ **BLOCKED** (2/2 users - both approved)
- Error: "Company has reached its maximum user limit (2 users)"

**Step 8: Super Admin Increases Limit to 5**

- Company maxUsers updated: 2 → 5

**Step 9: User 3 Tries to Register**

- ✅ **Allowed** (2/5 users)
- Status: pending

**Step 10: Admin Approves User 3**

- ✅ **Allowed** (2/5 approved active users)
- User 3 status: approved, active

**Current State:**

- 3 approved active users
- Limit: 5 users
- Can add 2 more users

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Script Created

**File:** `server/test-user-limit.js`

**Run:**

```bash
cd server
node test-user-limit.js
```

**What it tests:**

1. ✅ Creates company with limit: 2
2. ✅ Creates 2 approved users
3. ✅ Verifies 3rd user is blocked
4. ✅ Increases limit to 5
5. ✅ Verifies 3rd user is now allowed
6. ✅ Verifies declined users don't count
7. ✅ Cleans up test data

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Set company limit to 2
- [ ] Register 2 users
- [ ] Try to register 3rd user → Should be blocked
- [ ] Increase limit to 5
- [ ] Try to register 3rd user → Should succeed
- [ ] Create declined user
- [ ] Verify count doesn't include declined user
- [ ] Try to approve pending user when at limit → Should be blocked
- [ ] Try to approve pending user when under limit → Should succeed
