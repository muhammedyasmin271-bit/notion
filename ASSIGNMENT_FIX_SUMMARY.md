# Project Assignment Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ProjectsPage.js
- **Fixed commented out onChange handler** in the assignment input field
- **Updated handleSaveEdit function** to properly save assignments to the backend
- **Added notification sending** when users are assigned to projects

### 2. ProjectDetailPage.js  
- **Fixed selectUser function** to handle both username and name fields
- **Added notification sending** when users are assigned through the user picker
- **Improved user selection logic** for better reliability

### 3. Backend Integration
- The backend (projects.js) already has proper assignment handling and notification creation
- Notifications are sent when projects are assigned or updated
- User lookup works with name, username, or email matching

## How to Test the Fix

### Method 1: Manual Testing
1. Start both frontend and backend servers
2. Login as a manager (admin@example.com / admin123)
3. Go to Projects page
4. Create a new project or edit an existing one
5. In the "For (person)" field, enter a username like "john" or "jane"
6. Save the project
7. Login as the assigned user to verify they received the project

### Method 2: Using Debug Component
1. Add the AssignmentDebug component to your app temporarily
2. Import it in App.js: `import AssignmentDebug from './components/debug/AssignmentDebug';`
3. Add `<AssignmentDebug />` to a route for testing
4. Use the "Test Assignment Functionality" button

### Method 3: Using Test Script
1. Run `node test-assignment.js` in the project root
2. Follow the interactive prompts to test the functionality

## Key Changes Made

1. **Assignment Input Field**: Now properly updates when typing
2. **Save Functionality**: Assignments are saved to the database
3. **Notifications**: Users receive notifications when assigned
4. **User Picker**: Works with both username and display name
5. **Backend Integration**: Proper API calls with error handling

## Troubleshooting

If assignments still don't work:

1. **Check Console Logs**: Look for JavaScript errors in browser console
2. **Check Server Logs**: Look for API errors in the backend console  
3. **Verify Users Exist**: Make sure the users you're assigning exist in the database
4. **Check Permissions**: Ensure you're logged in as a manager/admin
5. **Test API Directly**: Use Postman to test the `/api/projects` endpoints

## Expected Behavior

After the fix:
- ✅ Assignment field accepts input
- ✅ Projects save with assignments
- ✅ Assigned users receive notifications
- ✅ Projects appear in assigned user's project list
- ✅ User picker works in project detail view
