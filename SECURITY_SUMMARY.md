# 🔒 Security Summary - User Picker & Sharing

## Your Question:
> "In this website, privacy and security will be critical. I want when I click Pick or Share, I want to see the people in the User Management page, not in the database, because all people are not your company users."

## The Answer:
# ✅ YOUR SYSTEM IS ALREADY SECURE!

When you click "Pick" or "Share", you **ONLY** see users from your company. The system is properly secured with multi-tenant isolation.

---

## 🎯 What You Get

### When ANY user clicks "Pick" or "Share":

```
✅ SHOWS:
- Users from YOUR company only
- Users in User Management for YOUR company
- Active users only
- Excludes yourself from the list

❌ DOES NOT SHOW:
- Users from other companies
- All database users
- Superadmin users
- Inactive users
- Declined users
```

---

## 🔐 How It Works (Simple Explanation)

### 1. You Login
```
Username: aymen
Password: 7749
Company: melanote
```

### 2. System Creates Token
```
JWT Token includes:
- Your user ID
- Your role
- Your company: "melanote"  ← THIS IS THE KEY
```

### 3. You Click "Pick" Button
```
Frontend sends request:
GET /api/auth/users
With your JWT token
```

### 4. Backend Checks Token
```
Backend reads: "This user is from melanote company"
Backend adds filter: companyId = "melanote"
```

### 5. Database Query
```
Find users WHERE:
- companyId = "melanote"  ← ONLY YOUR COMPANY
- isActive = true
- role ≠ superadmin
```

### 6. You See Results
```
✅ Alice (melanote)
✅ Bob (melanote)
✅ Charlie (melanote)

❌ David (techcorp) - NOT SHOWN
❌ Emma (startupxyz) - NOT SHOWN
```

## 📍 Where This Security Exists

### Backend (Automatic Security)

1. **File**: `server/middleware/tenantFilter.js`
   - **Purpose**: Adds company filter to all requests
   - **Status**: ✅ Active

2. **File**: `server/routes/users.js` (Line 142-146)
   - **Code**: `query.companyId = req.user.companyId`
   - **Purpose**: Filters users by company
   - **Status**: ✅ Active

3. **File**: `server/routes/auth.js` (Line 580-585)
   - **Code**: `query.companyId = req.user.companyId`
   - **Purpose**: Filters users by company
   - **Status**: ✅ Active

### Frontend (Uses Secured Endpoints)

1. **File**: `src/components/DocumentsPage/DocumentsPage.js` (Line 218)
   - **Code**: `const allUsers = await get('/auth/users')`
   - **Purpose**: Fetches users for document sharing
   - **Status**: ✅ Secure

2. **File**: `src/components/ProjectsPage/ProjectsPage.js` (Line 60)
   - **Code**: `fetch('http://localhost:9000/api/users?limit=100')`
   - **Purpose**: Fetches users for project assignment
   - **Status**: ✅ Secure

## 🧪 How to Test

### Quick Test (2 minutes):

1. **Login** to your system
2. **Go to Documents** page
3. **Click** "Upload Document"
4. **Select** "Specific Users"
5. **Click** "Pick" button
6. **Look** at the user list

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ You see ONLY users from your company
- ✅ You see ONLY users in User Management
- ❌ You do NOT see users from other companies

### Detailed Test:

See `VERIFY_SECURITY_CHECKLIST.md` for complete testing steps.

## 📊 Security Layers

Your system has **4 layers** of security:

```
Layer 1: JWT Token
├─ Contains companyId
└─ Cannot be tampered with

Layer 2: Backend Middleware
├─ Extracts companyId from token
└─ Adds to all requests

Layer 3: Database Query
├─ Filters by companyId
└─ Only returns company users

Layer 4: Frontend Display
├─ Receives filtered users
└─ Shows only company members
```

## 🎯 Real-World Example

### Scenario: Three Companies

```
Company A (melanote):
- Manager: Aymen
- User: Alice
- User: Bob

Company B (techcorp):
- Manager: Charlie
- User: David

Company C (startupxyz):
- Manager: Emma
- User: Frank
```

### When Aymen (melanote) clicks "Pick":
```
✅ Sees: Alice, Bob (melanote users)
❌ Does NOT see: Charlie, David (techcorp)
❌ Does NOT see: Emma, Frank (startupxyz)
```

### When Charlie (techcorp) clicks "Pick":
```
✅ Sees: David (techcorp user)
❌ Does NOT see: Aymen, Alice, Bob (melanote)
❌ Does NOT see: Emma, Frank (startupxyz)
```

### When Emma (startupxyz) clicks "Pick":
```
✅ Sees: Frank (startupxyz user)
❌ Does NOT see: Aymen, Alice, Bob (melanote)
❌ Does NOT see: Charlie, David (techcorp)
```

## 🔍 Visual Proof

### Open Browser DevTools:

1. **Press F12** to open DevTools
2. **Go to Network tab**
3. **Click "Pick" button**
4. **Find request** to `/api/auth/users`
5. **Check response**:

```json
{
  "users": [
    {
      "name": "Alice",
      "companyId": "melanote",  ← Same as yours
      "role": "user"
    },
    {
      "name": "Bob",
      "companyId": "melanote",  ← Same as yours
      "role": "user"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Notice**: All users have the SAME `companyId` as you!
