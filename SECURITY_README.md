# 🔒 Security Documentation - User Picker & Sharing

## 🎯 Your Concern

> "In this website, privacy and security will be critical. I want when I click Pick or Share, I want to see the people in the User Management page, not in the database, because all people are not your company users."

## ✅ The Answer

**Your system is ALREADY SECURE!**

When you click "Pick" or "Share", you **ONLY** see users from your company. The system properly implements multi-tenant isolation with company-based filtering.
