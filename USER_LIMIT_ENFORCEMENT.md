# 🔒 User Limit Enforcement System

## ✅ Complete Implementation

The system now **enforces company user limits** across all user creation and approval endpoints.

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### User Limit Check

When a company has a `maxUsers` limit (e.g., 2 users), the system prevents:

1. ❌ **New registrations** when limit is reached
2. ❌ **Admin/Manager creating new users** when limit is reached
3. ❌ **Approving pending users** when limit is reached

### What Counts Towards the Limit

- ✅ **Approved users** (status: 'approved', isActive: true)
- ✅ **Pending users** (status: 'pending') - during registration
- ❌ **Declined users** (status: 'declined') - DO NOT count

---

## 🚫 Blocked Actions When Limit Reached

### 1. Public Registration (`/api/auth/register`)

**Scenario:** User tries to register via the public form

**Check:**

```javascript
const currentUserCount = await User.countDocuments({
  companyId: userCompanyId,
  status: { $ne: "declined" },
});

if (currentUserCount >= maxUsers) {
  return 403 - "Company has reached its maximum user limit (X users)";
}
```

**User sees:**

> ⚠️ This company has reached its maximum user limit (2 users). Please contact your administrator.

---

### 2. Manager/Admin Creating User (`/api/auth/register-user`)

**Scenario:** Manager/Admin tries to create a new user manually

**Check:**

```javascript
const currentUserCount = await User.countDocuments({
  companyId: req.user.companyId,
  status: { $ne: "declined" },
});

if (currentUserCount >= maxUsers) {
  return 403 - "Your company has reached its maximum user limit (X users)";
}
```

**Admin sees:**

> ⚠️ Your company has reached its maximum user limit (2 users). Please contact the super administrator to increase the limit.

---

### 3. Creating User via API (`/api/users POST`)

**Scenario:** Manager creates user via API

**Same check as above** - prevents creation when limit reached.

---

### 4. Approving Pending Users

#### Manager Approval (`/api/auth/users/:id/approve`)

**Scenario:** Manager tries to approve a pending user

**Check:**

```javascript
if (user.status === "pending") {
  const currentUserCount = await User.countDocuments({
    companyId: user.companyId,
    status: "approved",
    isActive: true,
  });

  if (currentUserCount >= maxUsers) {
    return 403 - "Cannot approve user. Company has reached limit";
  }
}
```

**Manager sees:**

> ⚠️ Cannot approve user. Company has reached its maximum user limit (2 users). Please contact the super administrator to increase the limit.

#### Admin Approval (`/api/auth/admin/users/:id/approve`)

**Same check** - prevents approval when limit reached.

#### API Approval (`/api/users/:id/approve`)

**Same check** - prevents approval when limit reached.

## 📊 Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Company Limit = 2

**Current State:**

- User 1: status='approved', isActive=true ✅
- User 2: status='approved', isActive=true ✅
- **Total approved users: 2**

**Actions:**

- ❌ User 3 tries to register → **BLOCKED** (limit reached)
- ❌ Admin tries to create User 3 → **BLOCKED**
- ❌ Manager tries to approve User 4 (pending) → **BLOCKED**

---

### Scenario 2: Company Limit = 2, One User Inactive

**Current State:**

- User 1: status='approved', isActive=true ✅
- User 2: status='approved', isActive=false ❌
- **Total approved active users: 1**

**Actions:**

- ✅ User 3 tries to register → **ALLOWED** (only 1 active approved user)
- ✅ Admin creates User 3 → **ALLOWED**

---

### Scenario 3: Company Limit = 2, Pending User

**Current State:**

- User 1: status='approved', isActive=true ✅
- User 2: status='pending', isActive=false ⏳
- **Total users (not declined): 2**

**Actions:**

- ❌ User 3 tries to register → **BLOCKED** (2 users including pending)
- ✅ Admin can approve User 2 → **ALLOWED** (only 1 approved active)
- ❌ After approval, User 3 tries to register → **BLOCKED** (now 2 approved)

---

### Scenario 4: Company Limit = 2, Declined User

**Current State:**

- User 1: status='approved', isActive=true ✅
- User 2: status='declined', isActive=false ❌
- **Total approved active users: 1**

**Actions:**

- ✅ User 3 tries to register → **ALLOWED** (declined users don't count)
- ✅ Admin creates User 3 → **ALLOWED**

## 🔧 Super Admin Controls

### Increasing User Limit

**Location:** Super Admin Dashboard → Company Details

**Steps:**

1. Click on company
2. Scroll to "Company Limits"
3. Click "Edit"
4. Change "Max Users" (e.g., from 2 to 10)
5. Click "Save Changes"

**API Endpoint:** `PATCH /api/admin/companies/:companyId/limits`

```json
{
  "maxUsers": 10
}
```

**Result:**

- Company can now have up to 10 approved active users
- Admins can register/create/approve users up to new limit

---

## 🎯 Default Limits

**Default Company Limits:**

```javascript
limits: {
  maxUsers: 50,        // Default 50 users per company
  maxStorage: 5GB      // Default 5GB storage
}
```

**Override per Company:**

- Super admin can set custom limits for each company
- Example: Company A = 10 users, Company B = 100 users
