# Company Settings Database Update - Fix Summary

## Problem

When clicking "Save Branding" in the Company Settings page, the error appeared:

```
Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON
```

This meant the company settings were **not being saved to the database**.

## Root Cause

The frontend was using **relative URLs** (e.g., `/api/company/branding`) which pointed to the React development server (port 3000) instead of the backend API server (port 9000). The React dev server returned an HTML error page, causing the JSON parsing error.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed API Endpoints in Frontend ✅

**File:** `src/components/AdminDashboard/CompanySettings.js`

Updated all 4 API calls to use the full backend URL:

```javascript
// OLD (❌ Wrong - points to React dev server)
fetch('/api/company/branding', ...)

// NEW (✅ Correct - points to backend server)
fetch('http://localhost:9000/api/company/branding', ...)
```

**Updated endpoints:**

- `fetchCompanyData()` → `/api/company/my-company` → `http://localhost:9000/api/company/my-company`
- `fetchCompanyStats()` → `/api/company/stats` → `http://localhost:9000/api/company/stats`
- `handleSaveBranding()` → `/api/company/branding` → `http://localhost:9000/api/company/branding`
- `handleSaveContact()` → `/api/company/contact` → `http://localhost:9000/api/company/contact`

### 2. Enhanced Backend Logging ✅

**File:** `server/routes/company.js`

Added comprehensive logging to track and verify database updates:

**Branding Update Logs:**

```javascript
🎨 Branding update request received
User companyId: COMP-XXX
✅ Company found: [Company Name]
Current branding: {...}
Updating company name from [old] to [new]
Updating primary color from [old] to [new]
Saving to database...
✅ Company branding saved successfully to database
Verification - branding after save: {...}
```

**Contact Update Logs:**

```javascript
📧 Contact info update request received
User companyId: COMP-XXX
✅ Company found: [Company Name]
Updating admin email from [old] to [new]
Saving to database...
✅ Contact information saved successfully to database
Verification - Email: [new], Phone: [new]
```

**Key improvements:**

- Shows before/after values for all fields
- Logs when `company.save()` is called
- Verifies save by re-fetching from database
- Returns detailed error messages

### 3. Enhanced Frontend Logging ✅

**File:** `src/components/AdminDashboard/CompanySettings.js`

Added detailed console logging for debugging:

```javascript
🎨 Starting branding save...
Form data: { companyName: '...', primaryColor: '...', hasLogo: true/false }
Sending request to backend...
Response status: 200
✅ Backend response: { ... }
Refreshing company data to verify save...
✅ Branding update complete!
```

### 4. Created Test Script ✅

**File:** `test-company-update.js`

Created a standalone test script to verify database updates:

```bash
node test-company-update.js
```

This script:

- Connects directly to MongoDB
- Finds a company
- Updates branding fields
- Verifies changes were saved to database
- Restores original values

### 5. Created Documentation ✅

**File:** `COMPANY_SETTINGS_DATABASE_UPDATE.md`

Comprehensive guide covering:

- How database updates work
- Database schema details
- 4 different testing methods
- Troubleshooting guide
- Verification checklist

## How It Works Now

### Complete Flow for Branding Update:

1. **User Action:** Admin fills in company name, color, uploads logo → clicks "Save Branding"

2. **Frontend (CompanySettings.js):**

   - Creates FormData with the form fields
   - Sends PUT request to `http://localhost:9000/api/company/branding`
   - Logs request details to browser console

3. **Backend (server/routes/company.js):**

   - Receives request with authentication token
   - Verifies user is admin with `requireAdmin` middleware
   - Finds company document: `Company.findOne({ companyId: req.user.companyId })`
   - Updates branding fields:
     ```javascript
     company.branding.companyName = req.body.companyName;
     company.branding.primaryColor = req.body.primaryColor;
     if (req.file) company.branding.logo = logoUrl;
     ```
   - **Saves to MongoDB:** `await company.save()` ← **Database update happens here**
   - Re-fetches company to verify save
   - Returns success response

4. **Frontend Response:**
   - Receives success message
   - Shows green alert: "Company branding saved to database successfully!"
   - Refreshes company data from database
   - Reloads page after 1.5 seconds to apply changes

## Database Updates Confirmed

The backend uses Mongoose's `save()` method which:

- ✅ Persists changes to MongoDB
- ✅ Validates schema
- ✅ Triggers middleware hooks
- ✅ Returns saved document

**Verification added:**
After saving, the backend re-fetches the company from database:

```javascript
await company.save();
const updatedCompany = await Company.findOne({ companyId: req.user.companyId });
console.log("Verification - branding after save:", updatedCompany.branding);
```

This guarantees the data was actually written to MongoDB.

## Testing & Verification

### Quick Test:

1. Open Company Settings page
2. Change company name or color
3. Click "Save Branding"
4. Open browser console (F12) - should see green checkmarks ✅
5. Open server console - should see save confirmations
6. Success message appears: "Company branding saved to database successfully!"
7. Reload page - changes should persist

### Database Verification:

```bash
# Option 1: Use test script
node test-company-update.js

# Option 2: Check MongoDB directly
mongosh
use notion-app
db.companies.find().pretty()
```

## Success Indicators

When everything is working, you'll see:

**Browser Console:**

```
✅ Backend response: { message: "Company branding updated successfully", branding: {...} }
✅ Branding update complete!
```

**Server Console:**

```
✅ Company branding saved successfully to database
Verification - branding after save: { companyName: "...", primaryColor: "...", logo: "..." }
```

**UI:**

- Green success message appears
- Changes persist after page reload
- Navbar shows updated company name/logo (if implemented)

## Important Notes

1. **Backend must be running:** Make sure server is running on port 9000

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm start
   ```

2. **MongoDB must be running:** The database must be accessible

   ```bash
   # Check if MongoDB is running
   mongosh
   ```

3. **User must be admin:** Only users with admin role can update company settings

4. **All updates are logged:** Check server console and browser console for detailed logs

## What Gets Saved to Database

### Branding Fields:

- `company.branding.companyName` - Display name for the company
- `company.branding.primaryColor` - Brand color (hex code)
- `company.branding.logo` - Path to uploaded logo file

### Contact Fields:

- `company.adminEmail` - Admin contact email
- `company.adminPhone` - Admin contact phone number

All changes are immediately persisted to the MongoDB `companies` collection via `await company.save()`.

---

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

The company settings now correctly update the database. All changes are:

- ✅ Sent to the backend API
- ✅ Saved to MongoDB via `company.save()`
- ✅ Verified by re-fetching from database
- ✅ Confirmed with detailed logging
- ✅ Persisted across page reloads
