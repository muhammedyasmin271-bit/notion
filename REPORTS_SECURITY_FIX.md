# 🚨 REPORTS SECURITY - CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES FIXED!

## ⚠️ CRITICAL Security Issues Found & FIXED

### Status: **NOW SECURE** ✅

---

## 🚨 Critical Vulnerabilities Discovered

### Vulnerability 1: NO Company Isolation! 🔴

**Risk Level: CRITICAL**

**Issue:**

- ❌ Report model had NO `companyId` field
- ❌ Reports from Company A visible in Company B
- ❌ Complete data leakage across companies
- ❌ **MOST CRITICAL vulnerability in entire system!**

**Fix:** ✅ Added `companyId` field to Report model

---

### Vulnerability 2: Cross-Company Sharing 🔴

**Risk Level: CRITICAL**

**Issue:**

- ❌ Could share reports with users from ANY company
- ❌ User validation had no company filter
- ❌ Shared reports visible across companies

**Fix:** ✅ All user validation now company-filtered

---

### Vulnerability 3: No Middleware Protection 🟠

**Risk Level: HIGH**

**Issue:**

- ❌ No `tenantFilter` middleware applied
- ❌ No automatic company filtering
- ❌ Manual filtering required (error-prone)

**Fix:** ✅ Applied auth + tenantFilter middleware

---

## 🔧 Complete Fixes Applied

### 1. Added CompanyId to Report Model

**File:** `server/models/Report.js` (Lines 57-62)

**Added:**

```javascript
companyId: {
  type: String,
  default: 'default',
  index: true,
  required: true
}
```

---

### 2. Applied Security Middleware

**File:** `server/routes/reports.js` (Lines 9-11)

**Added:**

```javascript
// Apply auth to all routes first, then tenant filtering
router.use(auth);
router.use(tenantFilter);
```

---

### 3. Fixed Report Creation

**Lines 44-50 & 140:**

**Before:**

```javascript
// ❌ No company validation for shared users
const existingUsers = await User.find({
  _id: { $in: sharedWith },
});

// ❌ No companyId set
const reportData = {
  owner: req.user.id,
  // Missing companyId!
};
```

**After:**

```javascript
// ✅ Validate users are from same company
const userQuery = { _id: { $in: sharedWith } };
if (req.user.role !== "superadmin") {
  userQuery.companyId = req.companyId;
}
const existingUsers = await User.find(userQuery);

// ✅ Set companyId
const reportData = {
  owner: req.user.id,
  companyId: req.companyId, // ✅ CRITICAL FIX
};
```

---

### 4. Fixed Report Fetching

**Lines 212-215:**

**Before:**

```javascript
// ❌ No company filter
const reports = await Report.find({ owner: req.user.id });
```

**After:**

```javascript
// ✅ Company filtered
const query = { owner: req.user.id };
if (req.user.role !== "superadmin") {
  query.companyId = req.companyId;
}
const reports = await Report.find(query);
```

---

### 5. Fixed Shared Reports Query

**Lines 245-263:**

**Before:**

```javascript
// ❌ Admins could see ALL shared reports (all companies!)
query = {
  sharedWith: { $exists: true, $ne: [] },
  owner: { $ne: req.user.id },
};

// ❌ Users could see shared reports from other companies
query = { sharedWith: req.user.id };
```

**After:**

```javascript
// ✅ Admins see only THEIR COMPANY's shared reports
query = {
  $and: [
    { sharedWith: { $exists: true, $ne: [] } },
    { owner: { $ne: req.user.id } },
    { companyId: req.companyId }, // ✅ CRITICAL FIX
  ],
};

// ✅ Users see only shared reports from THEIR COMPANY
query = {
  sharedWith: req.user.id,
  companyId: req.companyId, // ✅ CRITICAL FIX
};
```

---

### 6. Fixed Report Sharing Endpoint

**Lines 406-416:**

**Before:**

```javascript
// ❌ Could share with users from ANY company!
const validUsers = await User.find({
  _id: { $in: userIds },
});
```

**After:**

```javascript
// ✅ Can only share with users from YOUR company
const userQuery = { _id: { $in: userIds } };
if (req.user.role !== "superadmin") {
  userQuery.companyId = req.companyId; // ✅ CRITICAL FIX
}
const validUsers = await User.find(userQuery);
console.log("✅ Sharing report with", validUsers.length, "users from company");
```

## 🔒 Security Before & After

### Before - CATASTROPHIC SECURITY FAILURE:

```
Company A creates report "Q4 Financial Data"
Shares with "all users"
Result:
  🚨 Company B sees "Q4 Financial Data"
  🚨 Company C sees "Q4 Financial Data"
  🚨 ALL companies see sensitive data!
  🚨 MAJOR DATA BREACH!
```

### After - SECURE:

```
Company A creates report "Q4 Financial Data"
Shares with company users
Result:
  ✅ Only Company A users see it
  ✅ Company B cannot access it
  ✅ Complete isolation
  ✅ Data breach prevented!
```

---

## 🧪 Security Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Create & Share Report

**Company A:**

```bash
1. Login as Company A user
2. Create report "Quarterly Report"
3. Share with Company A users
4. Server logs:
   🆕 Creating new report with data:
   - companyId: comp_A
   ✅ Sharing report with 2 users from company
5. ✅ Only Company A users receive report
```

**Company B:**

```bash
1. Login as Company B user
2. View reports
3. ✅ Cannot see "Quarterly Report"
4. ✅ Complete isolation
```

### Test 2: Shared Reports View

**Company A Admin:**

```bash
1. Login as Company A admin
2. View "Shared with Me"
3. Query: { companyId: "comp_A", sharedWith: {...} }
4. ✅ See only Company A shared reports
```

**Company B:**

```bash
1. Login as Company B user
2. View "Shared with Me"
3. Query: { companyId: "comp_B", sharedWith: req.user.id }
4. ✅ See only Company B shared reports
```

## ✅ Security Checklist

**Report Routes:**

- ✅ POST /api/reports - Sets companyId, validates users
- ✅ GET /api/reports - Filters by companyId
- ✅ GET /api/reports/shared/with-me - Filters by companyId
- ✅ GET /api/reports/:id - Company scoped
- ✅ DELETE /api/reports/:id - Company scoped
- ✅ POST /api/reports/:id/share - Validates company users

**All 6 endpoints secured!** 🔒

## 💡 IMPORTANT: Database Migration Needed

Since we added `companyId` to the Report model, existing reports need to be updated:

### Option 1: Delete Existing Reports (Simplest)

```bash
# If you have no important reports
cd server
node -e "
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const Report = require('./models/Report');
require('dotenv').config();
mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGODB_URI).then(async () => {
  await Report.deleteMany({});
  console.log('✅ All reports deleted');
  process.exit();
});
"
```

### Option 2: Migrate Existing Reports

```bash
# Update existing reports with owner's companyId
# I can create a migration script if needed
```
