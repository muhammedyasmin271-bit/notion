# ✅ Document Sharing Security - Company Isolation Complete

## 🎯 Critical Security Fix

### The Problem:

**SECURITY VULNERABILITY!** When sharing documents:

1. ❌ "Share with All Users" → Shared with ALL users in database (all companies!)
2. ❌ "Share with Managers" → Shared with ALL managers (all companies!)
3. ❌ "Share with Specific Users" → Could share with users from other companies
4. ❌ Documents from Company A visible in Company B

### The Solution:

✅ All sharing now filtered by `companyId`
✅ "Share with All" means "all users in YOUR company only"
✅ Cannot share with users from other companies
✅ Complete company isolation

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Middleware Order (`server/routes/documents.js`)

**Before:**

```javascript
router.use(tenantFilter);  // ❌ Runs before auth
router.get('/', auth, async (req, res) => {...});
```

**After:**

```javascript
router.use(auth);          // ✅ Auth first
router.use(tenantFilter);  // ✅ Then set companyId
router.get('/', async (req, res) => {...});
```

### 2. Fixed "Share with All Users" (Lines 283-294)

**Before:**

```javascript
if (sendTo === "all") {
  // ❌ Gets ALL users from entire database!
  usersToShareWith = await User.find({
    isActive: true,
    _id: { $ne: req.user.id },
  });
}
```

**After:**

```javascript
const shareQuery = {
  isActive: true,
  _id: { $ne: req.user.id },
};
// ✅ Filter by company!
if (req.user.role !== "superadmin") {
  shareQuery.companyId = req.companyId;
}

if (sendTo === "all") {
  usersToShareWith = await User.find(shareQuery);
}
```

### 3. Fixed "Share with Managers" (Line 292)

**Before:**

```javascript
// ❌ All managers from all companies
usersToShareWith = await User.find({
  role: "manager",
  isActive: true,
  _id: { $ne: req.user.id },
});
```

**After:**

```javascript
// ✅ Only managers from your company
usersToShareWith = await User.find({
  ...shareQuery, // includes companyId filter
  role: "manager",
});
```

### 4. Fixed "Share with Specific Users" (Lines 295-328)

**Before:**

```javascript
// ❌ Could find users from any company
usersToShareWith = await User.find({
  $or: [{ name: { $in: userNames } }, { username: { $in: userNames } }],
  isActive: true,
});
```

**After:**

```javascript
const specificQuery = {
  $or: [{ name: { $in: userNames } }, { username: { $in: userNames } }],
  isActive: true,
  _id: { $ne: req.user.id },
};
// ✅ Add company filter
if (req.user.role !== "superadmin") {
  specificQuery.companyId = req.companyId;
}
usersToShareWith = await User.find(specificQuery);
```

### 5. Added Debug Logging

**Document Creation:**

```javascript
console.log("🔵 Creating document:", title);
console.log("🔵 User:", req.user.username, "CompanyId:", req.companyId);
console.log("🔵 Document sharing - sendTo:", sendTo);
```

**Share Endpoint:**

```javascript
console.log("🔵 Sharing document with shareType:", shareType);
console.log("🔵 User query for sharing:", userQuery);
console.log("✅ Found users to share with:", count, "users in company");
```

## 📊 How Document Sharing Works Now

### Share Options & Their Meaning:

**1. Share with "All Users"**

```
Before: All users in entire database ❌
After:  All users in YOUR company only ✅
```

**2. Share with "Managers"**

```
Before: All managers in entire database ❌
After:  All managers in YOUR company only ✅
```

**3. Share with "Specific Users"**

```
Before: Could select users from any company ❌
After:  Only users from YOUR company ✅
```

**4. User Picker Dropdown**

```
Before: Showed all users from database ❌
After:  Shows only users from YOUR company ✅
```

## 🔒 Security Verification

### Test Case 1: Share with "All Users"

**Company A (3 users):**

```
Admin creates document
Shares with "All Users"
Query: { isActive: true, companyId: "comp_A" }
Result: Shares with 2 users (excluding self) from Company A ✅
```

**Company B (5 users):**

```
Query: { isActive: true, companyId: "comp_B" }
Result: CANNOT see Company A's document ✅
```

### Test Case 2: Share with Specific Users

**Company A:**

```
User picks from dropdown
Dropdown shows: Only Company A users ✅
Cannot pick: Company B users ❌
```

### Test Case 3: Document Visibility

**Company A:**

```
Creates document → companyId: "comp_A"
Shares with all → Only Company A users
Document visible: Only in Company A ✅
```

**Company B:**

```
Fetches documents
Query filter: { companyId: "comp_B" }
Result: Only sees Company B documents ✅
Cannot see: Company A documents ❌
```
