### Critical Areas for Manual Verification

1. **Multi-Tenant Data Isolation** (CRITICAL)

   - Verify Company A cannot see Company B's data
   - Test projects, documents, notes, meetings isolation
   - Verify user lists are filtered by company

2. **Authentication Flow**

   - Login with company credentials
   - Registration process
   - Password reset functionality

3. **Payment System**

   - Payment submission by company admin
   - Payment verification by super admin
   - Screenshot upload
   - Multi-month selection

4. **Company Management**

   - Create/pause/unpause/delete companies
   - Set company-specific pricing
   - User limit enforcement

5. **Sharing Features**

   - Share projects within company
   - Share documents within company
   - Verify sharing blocked across companies

6. **CRUD Operations**
   - Projects: Create, Read, Update, Delete
   - Documents: Upload, View, Delete
   - Notes: Create, Edit, Delete
   - Meetings: Create, Edit, Delete
   - Tasks & Goals: Full lifecycle
