## ⚠️ WHAT YOU NEED TO TEST MANUALLY

I've created detailed guides for you:

### 📋 Main Testing Guide

**File:** `COMPLETE_TESTING_GUIDE.md`

This contains **150+ test cases** covering:

1. **Authentication** - Login, register, logout
2. **Super Admin Features** - Company management, payment verification
3. **Company Admin Features** - Payment submission, user management
4. **Multi-Tenant Isolation** - CRITICAL - Data separation between companies
5. **Core Features** - Projects, documents, notes, meetings, tasks
6. **Sharing & Security** - Within company sharing, cross-company blocking
7. **Payment System** - End-to-end payment workflow
8. **Responsive Design** - Mobile, tablet, desktop
9. **Performance** - Load times, error handling

### 🎯 Critical Tests (DO THESE FIRST)

#### Test 1: Multi-Tenant Isolation (30 min)

**WHY:** Most important security feature

1. Create 2 test companies as super admin
2. Open Company A in one browser
3. Open Company B in another browser
4. Create projects in each
5. **VERIFY:** Company A cannot see Company B's projects
6. Repeat for: documents, notes, meetings, users

#### Test 2: Payment System (15 min)

**WHY:** Core billing functionality

1. Login as company admin
2. Go to `/admin/payments`
3. Click "How to Pay" - verify payment info shows
4. Submit a payment with screenshot
5. Login as super admin
6. Approve/reject the payment
7. Verify admin sees the status update

#### Test 3: Authentication Flow (10 min)

**WHY:** Basic access control

1. Try logging in with credentials
2. Test registration process
3. Verify logout works
4. Try accessing pages without login

## 🎯 MOST IMPORTANT TESTS

### 🔴 CRITICAL (Do First)

1. **Multi-tenant data isolation** - Companies cannot see each other's data
2. **Payment workflow** - Submission → Approval → Status update
3. **User authentication** - Login/register/logout works

### 🟡 HIGH (Do Second)

4. **CRUD operations** - Create, read, update, delete for all features
5. **Sharing features** - Only works within same company
6. **User management** - Approval workflow, user limits

### 🟢 MEDIUM (Do When Time Permits)

7. **UI/UX testing** - Responsive design, error messages
8. **Performance** - Load times, large data sets
9. **Edge cases** - Invalid inputs, boundary conditions
